      "intro": "Ever wondered how to balance economic, social and environmental interests?\n\nIn this game, you can explore how preferences on the three dimensions of sustainability - economy, society, and environment - affect what future power system design is perceived as optimal.\n\nFor a start you get assigned a Point Of View (POV) that indicates you how you need to weigh the three dimensions of sustainability when making decisions on the future European power system design throughout the game. Depending on the POV you could for example imagine that you are a representative of an industrial company, an environmental agency, or a social organisation.\n\nThe goal is to maximise your score in the year 2050. The score is based on the three indicators that you see on the right hand side of the window, each relating to one of the three dimensions of sustainability. You can click on the indicators to illustrate them in the map. In the map you can select individual countries to explore their performance over time.\n\nOne can quickly play multiple rounds of the game. Each round you get assigned a new POV. You will therefore in each round need to think about how the decisions you make relate to your POV. At the end of each round you can access the 'Score'-board and see how your POV, decisions, and score compare across rounds.\n\nThe indicators and score are calculated based a large number of scenarios from the Open Source energy Model Base for Europe (OSeMBE), an open-source energy system optimisation model. You can read more about this game in the 'About' section, including the link to the documentation of OSeMBE."
